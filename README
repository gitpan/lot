Introduction

This is set of simple modules to aid the writing of dinky
little cgi scripts to run an auction on a site. All the 
documentation you need are included as pod in the modules.

There is only one snag. I use this with mySQL, and Class::DBI.
I have not tested this with any other platforms, due to having a
job to go to everyday. Ah well.

So, you will need Class::DBI, which is a good thing anyway. And, out
of interest, the author of Class::DBI has sworn at me before. I feel
so proud.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this README
file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   make install

The Tables.

I have included the table definitions, I am so helpful!

The Connection.

OK, the one thing I can't do for you is know how you connect to your
database, or indeed your password/username combo. So you will have to
get yourself a database handle. Sorry! I wanted this to be a black box
solution, but couldn't think of how, as I know not your circumstances.

The Scripts.

You don't really need me to write them, do you? ;-) I do have example ones,
if you really want. All done with the ever-lovely and fragrant CGI object. Which
I find useful, as I don't like writing HTML. At all.
